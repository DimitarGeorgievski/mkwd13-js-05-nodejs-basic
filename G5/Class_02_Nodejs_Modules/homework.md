# Filesystem Homework

## Basic Requirements

1. Initialize a new npm project and create an `index.js` file.
2. Using the fs module, create a new file called `homework.txt`.
3. Create a path to the file using the `path` module.
4. Write the following text to the file: "Homework 02 in Basic Node".
5. Append the following text to the file: "FINISHED!".
6. Read the file contents and print them to the console.

- Don't forget to add a `.gitignore` file to your project as always.

## Bonus (OPTIONAL)

1. Using the task manager code from class, use the function called `markTaskAsCompleted` that allows you mark task as completed.
2. Add an `owner` property (owner should be a random unique email, example: `some.user@mail.com`) to all tasks and create a function `getTasksByOwner` that returns all tasks for a given owner.
3. Create a `deleteAll` function for the task service that deletes all tasks currently in `tasks.json`.

_Note: These homework assignments are not meant to determine whether you pass Basic Node. They are designed to help you practice and become comfortable with the concepts as we progress. Feel free to review the code from yesterday, make edits, experiment with changes, and test out the file system and its various functions._

_This homework is due in 7 days._
